# Boop

An iMessage-based personal agent you can run with either your Claude Code subscription or your Codex / ChatGPT subscription.

Choose your runtime during setup:

- **Claude** — powered by the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview) and your local Claude Code login.
- **Codex** — powered by the local Codex app-server runtime and your local `codex login`.

No Anthropic or OpenAI API key is required for the agent runtime when using subscription auth.

</p>

> **This is a starting point, not a finished product.**
> It's the architecture I built for my own personal agent, opened up as a template so you can take it, text-enable your own Claude or Codex-backed agent, and extend it however you want. Integrations are plugged in via [Composio](https://composio.dev/?utm_source=chris&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=collab) — drop in an API key and connect Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, and ~1000 others straight from the debug dashboard.

```
 iMessage  →  Sendblue webhook  →  Interaction agent  →  Sub-agents (per task)

                                    Memory store  ←──  Integrations (your MCP tools)
```

Built on:
- [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript) or local Codex runtime — choose your provider during setup
- [Composio](https://composio.dev/?utm_source=chris&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=collab) — integrations layer. One API key = Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Stripe, Supabase, + ~1000 more with hosted OAuth
- [Sendblue](https://sendblue.com/?utm_source=raroque) — iMessage in/out (free on their agent plan)
- [Convex](https://convex.link/chrisraroque) — real-time database for memory, agents, drafts
- Your Claude Code or Codex/ChatGPT subscription — no separate provider API key required

---

## What you get

- **iMessage in / iMessage out** via Sendblue (with typing indicators and webhook dedup).
- **Sendblue CLI integration** — `npm run dev` auto-registers the inbound webhook for you every restart (no re-pasting into the dashboard when free ngrok rotates your URL).
- **Dispatcher + workers** pattern: a lean interaction agent decides what to do, spawns focused sub-agents that actually do the work.
- **Pure dispatcher** — the interaction agent has only memory + spawn + automation + draft tools. Web access, files, and integrations are explicitly denied to it; sub-agents get `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` / the integrations.
- **Tiered memory** (short / long / permanent) with post-turn extraction, decay, and cleaning.
- **Vector search** for recall when you add an embeddings key (Voyage or OpenAI) — falls back to substring.
- **Memory consolidation** — a daily 3-phase adversarial pipeline (proposer → adversary → judge) that merges duplicates, resolves contradictions, and prunes noise. Uses the configured runtime, with provider-specific model defaults. Runs every 24h by default, also triggerable manually via `POST /consolidate`.
- **Automations** — the agent can schedule recurring work from a text ("every morning at 8 summarize my calendar") and push results back to iMessage.
- **Draft-and-send** — any external action stages a draft first; the agent only commits when the user confirms.
- **Heartbeat + retry** — stuck agents auto-fail, debug dashboard can retry.
- **Composio-powered integrations** — one API key unlocks 1000+ toolkits. Connect Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Drive, HubSpot, etc. with a click from the debug dashboard. Composio handles OAuth + token refresh.
- **Optional local browser use** — when enabled in Settings, spawned agents can use a Patchright-backed Chrome profile for login-required services, visual workflows, or pages that reject ordinary automation.
- **Optional local Apple data** — Mac-only, read-only iMessage, Apple Notes, and Apple Reminders connectors that stay off until you enable Apple data and connect each source in the debug dashboard.
- **Debug dashboard** (React + Vite) with a Boop mascot — Dashboard (usage, known cost, tokens, agent status), Agents (timeline + integration logos), Automations, Memory (table + force-directed graph), Events, Connections.
- **Convex** for persistence — real-time, typed, free tier.
- **Uses your Claude Code or Codex/ChatGPT subscription** — choose during setup, with no separate provider API key required.

## Heads up before you use this

- **This was never meant to be open-sourced.** I built it for personal use and decided to share the architecture after enough people asked. It's not a product.
- **Not optimized for cost or security.** Use at your own risk. Review the code, set your own budgets, and don't trust it with anything you wouldn't trust yourself with.
- **I'm open to PRs for optimizations** — performance, bug fixes, DX improvements, new example integrations, better docs.

## Why is it named Boop?

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/luna.jpeg" alt="Luna" width="220" />
  <br>
  <sub><em>Luna, the inspiration.</em></sub>
</p>

Boop is meant to be a proactive agent — one that nudges you over iMessage with reminders, drafts, and little follow-ups. A small "boop" whenever it has something for you.

And it's named after my dog, Luna, who gives plenty of them.

## A note on the native iOS app

I'm working on open-sourcing the native iOS app I originally built for this. The rewrite is taking much longer to get right than I'd hoped, but it will happen. I don't personally use it anymore — but enough people have asked, and I want to make it happen.

If you want to see what it looked like before I transitioned to an iMessage-based agent, here's [the walkthrough on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h2EnRfxMQE).

---

## Prerequisites

You need accounts for these. Keep the tabs open — setup will ask for credentials from each.

> **You should be able to get away with the free plan for each service except your chosen agent subscription, and I'm working to secure discounts for you guys on the pro plans. If you work at any of these companies, please reach out!**

| Service | Why | Free? | Discount code |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.com/code?ref=chrisraroque) or Codex / ChatGPT | Powers the agent. Install the matching CLI, sign in once, Boop uses your local session. | Subscription required | Working on getting one (if you work here, please reach out!) |
| [Sendblue](https://sendblue.com/?utm_source=raroque) | iMessage bridge. Get a number, grab API keys. | Free on their agent plan | `RAROQUE20` — 20% off for 6 months (helpful if you plan to commercialize) |
| [Convex](https://convex.link/chrisraroque) | Database + realtime. | Free tier is plenty | Working on getting one (in touch with them 👀) |
| [Composio](https://composio.dev/?utm_source=chris&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=collab) | Integrations — one API key unlocks ~1000 toolkits. Optional if you just want chat + memory + automations without third-party access. | Free tier covers personal use | `CHRISXCOMPOSIO` — 1 month free on starter plan |
| [ngrok](https://ngrok.com?ref=chrisraroque) or similar | Expose your local port so Sendblue can reach it. | Free tier works | Working on getting one (if you work here, please reach out!) |

**Custom integrations welcome.** Composio covers the common catalog, but you're free to add your own MCP servers under `server/integrations/` and register them in `server/integrations/registry.ts` — the dispatcher treats them the same as Composio-backed ones (just named toolkits the execution agent can spawn against). Useful for in-house APIs, local tools, or anything Composio doesn't ship.

**Local browser use is fully optional.** Boop can expose a local Chrome/Chromium profile to spawned agents, but it is off by default. Enable it from the debug dashboard under **Settings → Local browser use** when you want browser automation for login-only services, visual workflows, or bot-wall-sensitive pages. The Patchright browser binary is installed only if you opt in during setup or click the install button in Settings.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone + install
git clone https://github.com/raroque/boop-agent.git
cd boop-agent
npm install

# 2. Install one agent runtime (one-time, global) and sign in
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude  # sign in, then Ctrl-C to exit
# or:
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login

# 3. Interactive setup — writes .env.local, creates Convex deployment, offers optional local browser use
npm run setup

# 4. Install ngrok (one-time) and authorize it
brew install ngrok
# or grab from https://ngrok.com/download
ngrok config add-authtoken <your-token>   # free at https://dashboard.ngrok.com

# 5. Start everything with one command — server, Convex, debug UI, and ngrok
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` prints color-prefixed output from all four processes and shows a banner with your ngrok webhook URL once the tunnel is live.

```
Public URL:        https://<abc123>.ngrok.app
Sendblue webhook:  https://<abc123>.ngrok.app/sendblue/webhook
```

On free ngrok, **the webhook auto-registers with Sendblue every boot** — no manual paste needed. For stable URLs (ngrok reserved or Cloudflare Tunnel), set the webhook once in the dashboard.

Text your Sendblue-provisioned number from a **different** phone. The agent replies.

> **⚠ ngrok free plan gives you a new URL every time.** That means every time you restart `npm run dev`, your Sendblue webhook URL is dead until you paste the new one in.
>
> If you're going to run this for more than a quick demo, **strongly recommend one of:**
> - **ngrok paid plan** — gives you a reserved domain that stays the same forever
> - **[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)** — free, stable subdomain, a bit more setup
> - Any other tunnel with a static URL (Tailscale Funnel, localtunnel reserved, etc.)
>
> If you use a non-ngrok tunnel, point it at `localhost:3456` yourself — `npm run dev` will still run the rest, just ignore its ngrok output and use your tunnel's URL.

> **Gotcha:** `SENDBLUE_FROM_NUMBER` must be your Sendblue-provisioned number (the one people text TO), not your personal cell. Sendblue's API requires it, and misconfiguring it returns either "missing required parameter: from_number" or "Cannot send messages to self".
>
> **Fix in one command:** `npm run sendblue:sync` pulls the right number from the Sendblue CLI and writes it to `.env.local`.

---

## How the Sendblue integration works

Boop uses the [Sendblue CLI](https://github.com/sendblue-api/sendblue-cli) (`@sendblue/cli`) to eliminate almost all manual dashboard work. Three NPM scripts wrap it:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run setup` | Interactive. Offers to run `sendblue login` / `sendblue setup` and pulls `api_key_id` + `api_secret_key` from `sendblue show-keys` into `.env.local`. |
| `npm run sendblue:sync` | Runs `sendblue lines`, parses your provisioned phone number, and writes `SENDBLUE_FROM_NUMBER` to `.env.local` in E.164 format. Run this anytime your number changes or got set wrong. |
| `npm run sendblue:webhook -- <url>` | Runs `sendblue webhooks list`, removes stale ngrok/tunnel hooks, and adds `<url>` as a `type=receive` inbound webhook. Called automatically by `npm run dev`. |

### The `npm run dev` lifecycle

```
 1. Preflight: confirm convex/_generated/ exists (else prompt to run setup).
 2. Spawn four children in parallel, each with a prefixed log stream:
       server │   (tsx watch server/index.ts)
       convex │   (npx convex dev — pushes schema + functions)
       debug  │   (vite dev server on :5173)
       ngrok  │   (if installed AND no static URL) exposes :PORT
 3. Wait for all four readiness signals:
       server → "listening on :PORT"
       convex → "Convex functions ready"
       debug  → "Local:  http://localhost:5173/"
       ngrok  → tunnel URL visible at http://127.0.0.1:4040
 4. Auto-register the webhook (FREE ngrok only, not reserved domains):
       webhook │ [webhook] removed stale https://old.ngrok-free.app/sendblue/webhook
       webhook │ [webhook] registered https://new.ngrok-free.app/sendblue/webhook (type=receive)
 5. Show the banner with dashboard + public URL + your Sendblue number.
```

The banner will look like:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Boop is ready — ngrok tunnel is live  (webhook auto-registered).

  🐶 Debug dashboard (click me):   http://localhost:5173
  🌐 Public URL:                   https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
  📮 Sendblue webhook (inbound):   https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/sendblue/webhook
  📱 Text this Sendblue number:    <sendblue-number>  (from a DIFFERENT phone)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### When auto-register fires vs when it doesn't

| Setup | Auto-register fires? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Free ngrok (default) | **Yes**, every boot | URL rotates; dashboard would be stale otherwise |
| Reserved `NGROK_DOMAIN` | No | URL is stable; configure once in Sendblue dashboard |
| Static `PUBLIC_URL` (Cloudflare Tunnel etc.) | No | Same reason |
| `SENDBLUE_AUTO_WEBHOOK=false` | No | Manual opt-out |

### What you'll see in the server logs during a conversation

When someone texts your Sendblue number, expect this sequence in your terminal:

```
server │ [turn a3f21d] ← <sender-number>: "what's on my calendar today?"
server │ [turn a3f21d] tool: recall({"query":"calendar today"})
server │ [turn a3f21d] tool: spawn_agent({"integrations":["google-calendar"],"task":"Pull today's events"})
server │ [agent 9e82c1] spawn: google-calendar [google-calendar] — "Pull today's events"
server │ [agent 9e82c1] tool: list_events
server │ [agent 9e82c1] done (completed, 2.1s, in/out tokens 1234/567)
server │ [turn a3f21d] → reply (3.4s, 140 chars): "Light day — just your 2pm with Sarah..."
server │ [sendblue] → sent 140 chars to <sender-number>
```

Per-line anatomy:

- **`[turn xxxxxx]`** — one iMessage round trip. Same id across `←` (incoming) → tool calls → `→ reply` → `[sendblue] sent`.
- **`[agent xxxxxx]`** — a spawned execution agent. Shows `spawn`, each `tool:` it invokes, and `done` with timing + token counts.
- **`[sendblue]`** — outbound send results. If Sendblue rejects, the error body is logged with a hint about the likely cause (from_number mismatch, self-send, etc.).

The same events are written to Convex (`messages`, `executionAgents`, `agentLogs`, `memoryEvents` tables) and streamed to the debug dashboard in real time.

### When to re-run each Sendblue script

- **First time / after losing `.env.local`** → `npm run setup` (walks through Sendblue + Convex together)
- **Phone number looks wrong in the banner** → `npm run sendblue:sync`
- **Webhook went stale in the dashboard and auto-register is off** → `npm run sendblue:webhook -- https://your-url.example.com/sendblue/webhook`

### Disabling auto-register

Add to `.env.local`:

```
SENDBLUE_AUTO_WEBHOOK=false
```

`npm run dev` will still show you the webhook URL in the banner so you can paste it yourself.

Visit `http://localhost:5173` for the debug dashboard (chat, agents, memory, events). You can also chat from the dashboard's Chat tab without Sendblue.

**This is the full first-run.** You now have a working agent that chats, remembers, and schedules reminders. Enable integrations (Gmail, Calendar, Notion, Slack) when you want more — see the next section.

```

- **Interaction agent** (`server/interaction-agent.ts`) is the front door. It reads the user's message + recent history, optionally calls `recall`, writes memories, creates automations, and decides whether to answer directly or spawn a sub-agent.
- **Execution agent** (`server/execution-agent.ts`) is spawned per task. It loads only the integrations named in the spawn call and returns a tight answer.
- **Memory** (`server/memory/`) handles writes, recall, post-turn extraction, and daily cleaning. Stored in Convex.
- **Automations** (`server/automations.ts`) poll every 30s for due jobs, spawn an execution agent to run them, and push results back to the user.
- **Integrations** are provided by [Composio](https://composio.dev/?utm_source=chris&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=collab). The dispatcher names toolkits by slug (`spawn_agent(integrations: ["gmail"])`); `server/composio.ts` opens a toolkit-scoped Composio session per spawn and wraps its tools as an MCP server. No per-integration code to write.
- **Local browser use** is a separate optional integration named `browser`. It appears to the dispatcher only after you enable it in Settings, and it controls a persistent local Chrome profile through Patchright.

---

## Skills

Skills are reusable playbooks — `SKILL.md` files that teach execution agents how to do a specific kind of task (write a YouTube script, draft a cold email, plan a trip, etc.).

Boop now has two runtime paths, so keep this distinction in mind:

- Claude runtime: the Claude Agent SDK loads project skills from `.claude/skills/` when the execution agent boots.
- Codex runtime: Boop keeps Codex-facing skills under `.agents/skills/`, while the core sub-agent loop, memory tools, draft tools, and integration tools are provided through Boop's runtime adapter.

For capabilities that must work under both providers, keep the skill instructions mirrored in both directories or move the behavior into Boop's runtime tools/prompts. This applies to both runtime skills and upgrade/migration skills referenced from `CHANGELOG.md`. The dispatcher never loads skills directly; only spawned execution agents should do real work.

Wiring (in `server/execution-agent.ts`):
- Claude runs with `settingSources: ["project"]` and `"Skill"` in `allowedTools`.
- Codex runs through `codex app-server` with Boop's dynamic runtime tools.

**To add a cross-runtime skill or migration:** create matching files:

- `.claude/skills/<kebab-name>/SKILL.md`
- `.agents/skills/<kebab-name>/SKILL.md`

Example:

```yaml
---
name: youtube-script-writer
description: Write a tight, retention-focused YouTube script from a topic or outline. Use when the user asks for a video script, wants to turn research into a video, or needs a hook rewritten.
---

<instructions the agent follows when this skill is invoked>
```

There's a soft budget (~15k chars by default, via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET`) for the combined skill-description block in context — if you end up with many skills, keep descriptions sharp so none get truncated.

Examples included: `.claude/skills/youtube-script-writer/`, `.agents/skills/youtube-script-writer/`, and mirrored `/upgrade-boop` skills for agent-assisted updates.

---

## Choosing Claude Code or Codex

`npm run setup` asks which subscription-backed runtime Boop should use:

- Claude Code subscription: uses the Claude Agent SDK and the credentials Claude Code writes to your machine when you sign in. You do not need an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- Codex / ChatGPT subscription: uses the local Codex app-server runtime and the credentials `codex login` writes to your machine. You do not need an `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the agent runtime.

For Claude:

- Install once: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Run `claude` in a terminal, sign in.
- That's it — the SDK finds the session automatically.

For Codex:

- Install once: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- Run `codex login` in a terminal, sign in.
- Boop reads that local auth. Set `BOOP_CODEX_AUTH_HOME` only if you need a custom Codex home.

If you'd prefer Claude API-key billing (e.g. for a deployed server), set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local` and the Claude SDK will use it instead. The Codex runtime path uses local Codex subscription auth.

---

## Environment variables

Everything lives in `.env.local` (auto-created by `npm run setup`). See `.env.example` for the full list.

| Var | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_CONVEX_URL` | yes | Convex deployment URL for the Vite debug UI. Written by `npx convex dev`; the server falls back to this value locally. |
| `CONVEX_URL` | optional | Server-only Convex URL override for non-Vite deployments. Leave unset locally to avoid Convex CLI ambiguity warnings. |
| `SENDBLUE_API_KEY` / `SENDBLUE_API_SECRET` | yes | From your Sendblue dashboard. |
| `SENDBLUE_FROM_NUMBER` | yes | Your Sendblue-provisioned number. |
| `BOOP_RUNTIME` | no | `claude` by default. Set `codex` to use local `codex app-server` with the ChatGPT/Codex account from `codex login`. |
| `BOOP_MODEL` | no | Default `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Used as the fallback when no runtime override is set. The user can switch the model at runtime from iMessage ("use opus", "switch to sonnet") via the `set_model` self-tool — that override is stored in the Convex `settings` table and takes precedence over this env var. |
| `BOOP_CODEX_MODEL` / `BOOP_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` | no | Codex defaults when `BOOP_RUNTIME=codex`. Defaults: `gpt-5.5` and `medium`. |
| `BOOP_CODEX_AUTH_HOME` | no | Optional path to a Codex home containing `auth.json`; otherwise Boop uses the current `codex login` auth. |
| `BOOP_BROWSER_ENABLED` | no | Fallback for Local browser use. Default `false`. Runtime settings in Convex take precedence once changed from the dashboard. |
| `BOOP_BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR` | no | Persistent Chrome profile directory. Default `~/.boop/browser-profile`. |
| `BOOP_BROWSER_SHOW_UI` | no | `true` opens a visible Chrome window; `false` runs hidden/headless. Default `true`. |
| `BOOP_BROWSER_LOGIN_HANDOFF` | no | Enables the agent's login handoff tool. Default `false`. |
| `BOOP_BROWSER_START_URL` | no | Optional URL to open when launching the local browser without an explicit URL. |
| `BOOP_BROWSER_CHANNEL` / `BOOP_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` | no | Chrome channel or explicit browser binary path for Patchright. Default channel `chrome`. |
| `BOOP_BROWSER_EXTRA_ARGS` | no | Optional newline-separated Chrome flags. Only `--flag` lines are used. |
| `BOOP_APPLE_ENABLED` | no | Fallback master switch for optional local Apple data. Default `false`. Once changed in the dashboard, the Convex `settings` row takes precedence over this env var. |
| `BOOP_APPLE_MESSAGES_ENABLED` / `BOOP_APPLE_NOTES_ENABLED` / `BOOP_APPLE_REMINDERS_ENABLED` | no | Per-source fallbacks for local iMessage, Apple Notes, and Apple Reminders. Each defaults to `false`, so enabling one source does not implicitly enable the others. |
| `BOOP_UPSTREAM_CHECK` | no | Set to `false` to disable the new-version banner on `npm run dev`. Default: on. |
| `PORT` | no | Default `3456`. |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | no | Base URL used in the Sendblue webhook. Composio handles its own OAuth callbacks on `platform.composio.dev`, so this is just for inbound iMessage. |
| `VOYAGE_API_KEY` **or** `OPENAI_API_KEY` | optional | Unlocks vector recall. Falls back to substring. |
| `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` | optional | Enables integrations. Without it, plain chat + memory + automations still work. Get one at [app.composio.dev/developers](https://app.composio.dev/developers?utm_source=chris&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=collab). |
| `COMPOSIO_USER_ID` | optional | Stable user id Composio keys connections under. Defaults to `boop-default`. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | optional | Bypass the Claude Code subscription for the Claude runtime. |

## Local browser use

Local browser use is for cases where a normal API integration or web fetch is the wrong tool: login-required portals, visual browser workflows, JavaScript-heavy apps, or services that may detect bot-like automation. It is deliberately opt-in.

How it works:

1. Open the debug dashboard → **Settings → Local browser use**.
2. Turn on **Local browser use**. Until this is enabled, agents do not see the `browser` integration at all.
3. Choose whether the browser should be visible with **Show browser UI**. On means a local browser window opens on your machine; off runs hidden/headless.
4. Turn on **Spawn login instance** only when you want the agent to hand control to you for login or MFA. The agent will say: "I need you to log in first. I’ve spawned an instance on your machine."
5. Use **Install Patchright browser** if Patchright has not installed its browser binary yet.

The browser uses a persistent Chrome/Chromium profile, so cookies and login state can carry across runs. Boop does not store third-party service passwords or OAuth tokens for this feature; those live in the local browser profile you choose. The `browser_fill` tool redacts typed values before agent tool-use logs are stored. Settings are stored in Convex under the `settings` table, with `.env.local` values used only as fallbacks.

Browser control HTTP routes are local-only. Requests forwarded through a public tunnel are rejected, so your ngrok/Sendblue URL cannot launch, close, or install a local browser.

For Codex runtime, local browser tools are exposed internally under the `local_browser` namespace to avoid Codex's reserved browser namespace. The user-facing integration name remains `browser`.

## Local Apple data

Local Apple data is optional, Mac-only, and read-only. It is designed for private single-user local runs where you want Boop to answer questions about data already on the Mac running the server.

It is off by default in two layers:

1. The master Apple data switch must be enabled.
2. Each source must be connected separately: iMessage, Apple Notes, and Apple Reminders.

Turn it on from the debug dashboard:

1. Start Boop locally with `npm run dev`.
2. Open `http://localhost:5173`.
3. Go to **Connections → Local Mac**.
4. Click **Connect** only for the sources you want Boop to read.
5. Use **Disconnect** to turn any source off again.

You can also view the overall Apple status from **Settings → Apple data**. Dashboard changes are stored in Convex's `settings` table and override `.env.local` fallbacks. The env vars in `.env.example` are useful for first-run defaults, but they are not required.

| Source | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| iMessage / SMS history | Full Disk Access for the terminal, Codex app, or process running `npm run dev` | Reads `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` locally through `/usr/bin/sqlite3`. |
| Apple Notes | macOS Automation permission for Notes | Uses `/usr/bin/osascript` and exposes search/read tools only. |
| Apple Reminders | macOS Automation permission for Reminders | Uses `/usr/bin/osascript` and exposes list tools only. |
| Apple Calendar | Optional Apple bridge | Calendar events are not read by the local server path in this repo. |

The control routes for local Apple data are localhost-only; public tunnel traffic cannot enable or disable local Apple access. Tool output is redacted before it reaches the agent/user: phone numbers and contact handles are hidden in Apple outputs, replies, and outgoing iMessage/log paths.

On non-macOS machines, Local Mac connection cards are hidden or report unavailable. Composio integrations and the rest of Boop continue to work normally.

---

## Integrations, via Composio

Boop outsources 3rd-party service integrations to [Composio](https://composio.dev/?utm_source=chris&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=collab). One API key unlocks ~1000 toolkits (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Drive, Stripe, Supabase, HubSpot, Salesforce, Granola, and so on). Composio hosts the OAuth apps, manages token refresh, and exposes every toolkit as tools Boop can adapt for either runtime. Boop never sees an access token.

### Quickstart

1. Grab an API key at [app.composio.dev/developers](https://app.composio.dev/developers?utm_source=chris&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=collab).
2. Add it to `.env.local`:
   ```
   COMPOSIO_API_KEY=sk-comp-...
   ```
3. `npm run dev`.
4. Open the debug dashboard → **Connections** tab. You'll see a curated list of ~20 cards. For each one: click **Connect**, authenticate on Composio's hosted page, done — Composio ships managed OAuth for every curated toolkit. (If you add a custom toolkit that needs your own OAuth app, the card flips to a "Set up →" state pointing at `platform.composio.dev/auth-configs` — rare, but supported.)

After a successful connect, the agent can use that toolkit immediately — no restart.

### How it wires in

Boop keeps the dispatcher / executor split intact. Composio sits under the executor:

```
interaction-agent:  spawn_agent(task, integrations: ["gmail", "slack"])
                              │
                              ▼
execution-agent:    for each slug, open a Composio session scoped to that toolkit:
                      composio.create(BOOP_USER, { toolkits: ["gmail"] })
                      session.tools()          ← returns only Gmail tools
                              │
                              ▼
                    Claude: createSdkMcpServer({ name: "gmail", tools })
                    Codex:  dynamic runtime tools
                              │
                              ▼
                    Sub-agent sees mcp__gmail__GMAIL_*  — nothing else.
```

Key properties:

- **Per-spawn tool scope.** The dispatcher picks which toolkits the sub-agent sees. Tens of tools per spawn, not thousands, so context stays tight and the agent stays fast.
- **Toolkit slug = integration name.** `spawn_agent(integrations: ["linear"])` works for any toolkit you've connected. Unknown slugs just log a warning and are skipped.
- **No tokens on our side.** Every tool call runs through Composio's proxy. If Composio goes down, integrations go down — but your server never holds user OAuth tokens.
- **Multi-account per toolkit.** Connect a second Gmail (work + personal) — each gets its own connection row you can alias. The dispatcher picks up all active connections for the slug.
- **Identity resolution.** Connection cards show the real account email (e.g. `user@example.com`) resolved by calling the toolkit's own "who am I" tool through Composio (`GMAIL_GET_PROFILE`, etc.). Alias per connection if you want a friendlier label.

### Adding toolkits beyond the curated list

The ~20 toolkit catalog is hand-picked in `server/composio.ts:CURATED_TOOLKITS`. To surface another:

```ts
// server/composio.ts
export const CURATED_TOOLKITS: CuratedToolkit[] = [
  // …existing entries…
  { slug: "airtable", displayName: "Airtable", authMode: "managed" },
];
```

`authMode: "managed"` is correct for virtually every toolkit Composio ships today. Use `"byo"` only if Composio doesn't have a hosted OAuth app for that toolkit. If you guess wrong, the UI's auth-config fallback banner catches it and points you at the right dashboard page.

### Usage and cost tracking

Every LLM call — dispatcher turn, execution-agent run, memory extraction, proactive email classification, and consolidation (proposer / adversary / judge) — writes a row to the `usageRecords` table with runtime, billing mode, requested model, token counts, cache counts when available, and cost when the runtime exposes it.

Claude runtime: `total_cost_usd` comes from the Claude Agent SDK's `result` message, so Dashboard cost tiles and per-agent cards show real dollar amounts that should match Anthropic billing.

Codex runtime: `codex app-server` exposes token counts but not your actual subscription bill. Boop records `billingMode=codex-subscription`, stores the token counts, and estimates `costUsd` from OpenAI's published standard API token prices. Treat Codex dashboard spend as an API-equivalent usage proxy, not a bill.

### A note on runaway usage

Boop's Claude SDK `query()` calls don't currently set `maxTurns` or `maxBudgetUsd`. Those are hard stops the Claude SDK exposes — set them and the agent aborts once the threshold hits, with whatever partial result it has. Codex subscription runs do not currently have the same dollar-budget stop because the app-server path exposes token counts, and Boop's Codex dollar amounts are estimates derived from those counts.

Kept as-is intentionally for a single-user personal agent: every task is scoped tight (spawned by the dispatcher with a specific task string + a small integration list), integrations are Composio-scoped per spawn so the tool surface stays small, and the existing 15-minute heartbeat (`server/heartbeat.ts`) marks any long-running agent as `failed` and aborts it. In practice execution agents complete in under 60 seconds.

If you deploy Boop in a higher-throughput setting, or hand it integrations that allow looping (webhooks, scrapers), add runtime-specific caps before opening it up to more users.

## Upgrading

Boop is a fork-and-own template. You customize your copy freely — system prompts, memory thresholds, extra tools — and pull upstream fixes in on your own schedule.

The intended path is **agent CLI-driven**:

```bash
codex                  # inside your repo
/upgrade-boop

# or:
claude
/upgrade-boop
```

`/upgrade-boop` is mirrored in `.agents/skills/upgrade-boop/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/upgrade-boop/SKILL.md`. It:

1. Refuses to run with a dirty working tree.
2. Creates a timestamped rollback tag.
3. Previews upstream changes bucketed by area (core / integrations / UI / schema / scripts / docs).
4. Merges (or cherry-picks, or rebases — your choice).
5. Runs `npm install` + `npm run typecheck`.
6. Parses `CHANGELOG.md` for `[BREAKING]` entries and offers to run the referenced migration skills.
7. Prints a rollback hash + any env-var additions you should copy into `.env.local`.

`/upgrade-boop` is for your local agent CLI operating on the repo. It is not exposed to the Boop SMS/web dispatcher. The Codex runtime used by Boop conversations runs with read-only sandboxing and no shell/file-write tools, so a text-message conversation cannot update the server.

### New-version notifications

Every time you run `npm run dev`, a small background check (`scripts/check-upstream.mjs`) asks your `upstream` remote if there are new commits. If there are, you'll see a banner up top with the count and a reminder to run `/upgrade-boop` from Codex or Claude. If you're up to date, or the check fails for any reason (offline, no `upstream` remote, timeout), it stays silent.

Behavior at a glance:

- `upstream` set, new commits → banner with the count
- `upstream` set, up to date → silent
- No `upstream` remote, on a fork → one-line hint on adding it
- No `upstream` remote, on the canonical repo → silent (you *are* upstream)

To turn it off:

- **Env var:** add `BOOP_UPSTREAM_CHECK=false` to `.env.local`
- **Or comment it out:** the call lives in `scripts/dev.mjs` — the `spawn("node", ["scripts/check-upstream.mjs"], ...)` block. Delete or comment that block and the check never runs.

### CHANGELOG

Every release lists additions under [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md), with `[BREAKING]` prefixes for anything that requires action. `/upgrade-boop` parses that format automatically.

## Troubleshooting

**Agent doesn't reply.**
- Check the server is running: `curl http://localhost:3456/health`
- Check the Sendblue webhook is pointed at `<public-url>/sendblue/webhook`
- Watch server logs. Look for `[sendblue]` and `[interaction]` messages.

**Convex errors / `VITE_CONVEX_URL is not set`.**
- Run `npx convex dev` manually. Ensure `.env.local` has `VITE_CONVEX_URL`; the server can use that locally.

**"Could not find public function for X:Y".**
- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `VITE_CONVEX_URL` in `.env.local` are pointing at different projects. `convex dev` pushes functions to `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` but the client reads from `VITE_CONVEX_URL`. Fix: make sure the URL has the same name as the deployment — `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:foo-bar-123` → `VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://foo-bar-123.convex.cloud`. Re-running `npm run setup` now auto-syncs these.

**Agent replies but can't use my integration.**
- Check `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`.
- Check the toolkit shows as **Connected** in the Connections tab.
- Watch server logs for `[composio] registered …` at boot and `[integrations] unknown integration: …` on spawn attempts.

**Agent says Local browser use is off.**
- Open the debug dashboard → **Settings → Local browser use** and turn it on. Agents cannot see or use the `browser` integration while it is disabled.
- If launch fails, click **Install Patchright browser** in that same section, then try **Launch** again.
- If you need to log in manually, also turn on **Spawn login instance** so the agent can open a visible handoff window.

**I want to skip Sendblue for now.**
- The server exposes `POST /chat` with `{ conversationId, content }` — curl or a tiny client can drive the agent directly, no iMessage required.

**Claude SDK says no credentials.**
- Run `claude` once and sign in, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.

**Codex says no credentials.**
- Run `codex login` once, or set `BOOP_CODEX_AUTH_HOME` to a Codex home containing `auth.json`.

**"Cannot send messages to self" / "missing required parameter: from_number".**
- `SENDBLUE_FROM_NUMBER` is set to your personal cell instead of your Sendblue-provisioned number. Run `npm run sendblue:sync` to pull the correct number from `sendblue lines` and write it to `.env.local`.

**"Dashboard crashed" in the debug UI.**
- The ErrorBoundary caught something. Check the server logs (`server │` stream) and the browser console — both will have the real error. Most common cause: a new Convex function hasn't been deployed yet. Restart `npm run dev` so `convex dev` re-pushes.
